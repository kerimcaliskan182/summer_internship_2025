# Summer Internship Program 2025

## Development Workflow

Please follow this workflow for all task submissions:

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
Create a new branch for your task using the following naming convention:
- Format: `task_[number]_[your_name]`

### 2. Implement Your Solution
- Work on your assigned task in the newly created branch
- Make regular commits with clear, descriptive messages

### 3. Push Your Changes
- Research how to push your local branch to the remote repository
- Make sure to push to your feature branch, not the main branch

### 4. Create a Pull Request
1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Create a Pull Request from your feature branch to the main branch
3. **Important**: Link your Pull Request to the corresponding GitHub issue
4. Include a clear description of your implementation approach
5. Add any relevant screenshots or documentation

## Pull Request Guidelines

Your Pull Request should include:
- **Title**: Clear and descriptive (e.g., "Task 1: Request Factory Implementation - John Doe")
- **Description**: Brief explanation of your solution approach
- **Issue Reference**: Link to the corresponding GitHub issue using `#issue_number`
- **Testing**: Information about how you tested your solution

## Branch Naming Convention
